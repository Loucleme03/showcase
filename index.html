    <h1>Lou's Portfolio </h1>
    <h5>The demos in this showcase were all created during my education at
Fleming College in 2023 from the GIS-applications specialist program.
I could not include any arcGIS pro or online demos as it was a 
school account and i no longer have access to the account. 
To see how the Javascript for the following demos were cretead, please click here
and scroll to the demo you want to look at. </h5>

    <h2 class = underline> Demo 3 - ArcGIS Maps SDK for Javascript  </h2>
    <p> This demonstration uses arcGIS Maps SDK for Javascript where it displays 2 raster images of the exact same clipping extent to show the difference
     in the landscape between 1984 and 2021.  The raster images were sourced from USGS. To see the difference you need to turn off visibility for one
     of the raster images. </p>

 <div> 
    <h2 class = underline> Demo 4 - esri-Leaflet Map </h2>
    <p> This demonstration uses the same raster images to display the changes in the landscape of the same clipping extent as used in demo 4. It
     uses esri-Leaflet instead and has a slider function to display the difference in the landscapes overtime.</p>

    <p> This will open a pdf version of a storymap that was created by building the shapefiles in ArcGIS PRO and then put together using
    ArcGIS online - Storymaps app. Some of the pictures are cut off but it still shows some of the tools that were explored in my spatial analysis course and ability to use arcGIS online
    apps.</p>
