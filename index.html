    <h1>Lou's Portfolio </h1>
    <p>Thank you for visiting. The demos in this showcase were all created during my education at
Fleming College in 2023 from the GIS-applications specialist program. I created this webpage to illustrate a brief snapshot of some of the things I learnt from the program. </p>
  <p> It hightlights some work in autoCAD map 3D, ArcGIS PRO, web design, map api's and JavaScript. I could not include any arcGIS pro or online demos other than a storymap pdf (Demo 5) as it was a school account and I no longer have access to the account. 
   To see how the Javascript for the following demos were cretead, please <a href = "JavascriptDemo.js" target="_blank">click here</a> and scroll to the demo you want to look at. </p>
 <p>Below walks you through the demo's and you can click the button to go to the example or use the navbar.</p>

  <div> 
    <h2 class = underline> Demo 3 - Esri-Leaflet Map </h2>
    <p> This demonstration uses Esri Leaflet Maps where it displays 2 raster images of the exact same clipping extent to show the difference
     in the landscape between 1984 and 2021.  The raster images were sourced from USGS. To see the difference you can slide or click on the slider to show changes in landscape overtime. The image changes opacity from as you change the year of the slider to help compare. </p>

   </div>

   <div> 
    <h2 class = underline> Demo 4 - Remote Sensing </h2>
    <p> This will display a series of rendered images using PCI Geomatics Catalyst and some of the various techniques / processes from assignments that I completed in the program. NOTE: the quality of the images were reduced as they are snips of the original images and converted to jpg.</p>

  <div> 
    <h2 class = underline> Demo 5 - ArcGIS storymap pdf </h2>
    <p> This will open a pdf version of a storymap that was created by building the shapefiles in ArcGIS PRO and then put together using
    ArcGIS online - Storymaps app. Some of the pictures are cut off but it still shows some of the tools that were explored in my spatial analysis course and ability to use arcGIS online
    apps. Unfortunately I cannot go back to fix it as I no longer have acces to the account it was on.</p>
